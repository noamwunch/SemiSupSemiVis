WARNING:tensorflow:From /gpfs0/kats/users/wunch/miniconda3/envs/dark_jets/lib/python3.8/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/resource_variable_ops.py:1813: calling BaseResourceVariable.__init__ (from tensorflow.python.ops.resource_variable_ops) with constraint is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
If using Keras pass *_constraint arguments to layers.
